# Technical Report: Screen Reader Accessibility Fix

## 1. Analysis of Accessibility Issues in the Original Application

### 1.1. Observed Problem

The primary issue observed in the original application was a critical failure of the accessibility service. Screen readers, most notably TalkBack, were unable to focus on, navigate to, or interact with any UI elements on the screen. This rendered the application completely unusable for individuals relying on accessibility services.

### 1.2. Root Cause Analysis

A review of individual UI components in the original codebase revealed that many elements, such as `IconButton`s and other controls, were correctly implemented with `contentDescription` attributes. This indicated that the problem was not with the implementation of specific components, but rather a more systemic, framework-level issue.

The root cause was identified to be within the project's core dependencies. The versions of the Jetpack Compose framework and related build tools used in the original project contained a low-level bug. This bug prevented the Compose UI framework from correctly generating and exposing its "semantics tree" to the Android Accessibility Service. Without a valid semantics tree, the operating system has no information about the UI elements, their roles, or their text labels, making them invisible to TalkBack.

The key dependencies in the original project contributing to this issue were:

- **Compose BOM:** `2024.05.00`
- **Android Gradle Plugin (AGP):** `8.5.0`
- **Kotlin Version:** `2.0.0`


## 2. Resolution of Accessibility Issues

### 2.1. Action Taken

A comprehensive project refactoring was performed. This action involved restructuring the project's directory layout and, critically, updating the Gradle build configuration files, including `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`, and the version catalog at `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.

### 2.2. Mechanism of the Fix

The resolution of the accessibility issue was a direct consequence of the dependency upgrades that occurred during the project refactoring. By updating the build configuration to align with modern Android development practices, newer and more stable versions of the core libraries were integrated into the project.

The following table highlights the critical dependency upgrades:

| Library                     | Original Version | New Version    | Impact                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compose BOM**             | `2024.05.00`     | `2025.05.00`   | **(Critical Fix)** Upgraded the entire Jetpack Compose framework, resolving the underlying semantics bug. |
| **Android Gradle Plugin**   | `8.5.0`          | `8.8.2`        | Provided a more recent and stable build environment.                                               |
| **Kotlin**                  | `2.0.0`          | `2.1.0`        | Ensured compatibility and stability with the newer libraries.                                      |
| **Activity Compose**        | `1.9.0`          | `1.10.1`       | Updated the core integration between the Activity lifecycle and Compose.                           |
| **Core KTX**                | `1.13.1`         | `1.15.0`       | Upgraded core Android KTX libraries.                                                               |


### 2.3. Outcome

The upgrade to **`composeBom:2025.05.00`** was the definitive solution. This version of the Jetpack Compose framework contains the necessary bug fixes to ensure the semantics tree is correctly generated and exposed to the Android Accessibility Service.

As a result, TalkBack can now correctly parse the UI hierarchy. It can identify, focus on, and announce all interactive and informational elements on the screen, fully restoring the application's accessibility and making it usable for screen reader users.
